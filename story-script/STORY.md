## Introduction
Oh no! The pigs are going on their totally normal and scheduled migration to Mars!...
They've breached the facility and taken some of your near infinite supply of Falcon Heavies!

## Explanation of Game Mechanics
There's no way that you could ever be able to defeat the rocket boars by yourself with merely your near infinite supply of falcon heavies and riches.
The only way to defeat them is to use the pact you made with the Devil.
Now, you can buy all the powers of the world at the cost of your very own blood (and the blood of pigs)!
